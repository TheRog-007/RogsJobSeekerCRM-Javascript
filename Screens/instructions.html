      <!-- <br>
      <p>Welcome To Roger's Job Seeker CRM!</p>
      <br> -->
      <p>This is a port of the MS Access version including the DWP approved reports!
         <br><br>
         This application allows you to log your jobs applied for, report by sector, status and more!<br><br>
         Also has a mailshot facility that prints mailshot envelopes for you! CV/Letter printing is experimental as testing in live-server browser security would not allow it!
