ToDo list for the project

- bang head on table to assertain why jobs applied for listing CSS shows fonts a fraction
  of their ACTUAL size but mailshot listing report which I copied the CSS from works fine...

- blnNew needs to enforce whether user can type into screens when first loaded
- letter and cv printing - browser won't allow it via live-server! - need to test locally
- CV-Template Creator - not implemented at mo can't think of how to convert the Access form
  into HTML! 
- data validation for dates
