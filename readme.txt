What Is It?
===========

This is the JavaScript version of my JobseekersCRM using IndexedDB!

Yes this the conversion of a MSAccess database into JavaScript


Strategy
-------

- MVC structure
- schema module which has the table layouts for evey table plus:
  if field *required
  if field primary key

*Required fields have red labels on forms


- Uses my RogTab control to show the forms (web pages) in iFrames
- Uses global and local CSS files
